# Yes We Bike
We are a group of students from Data Engineering in Universidat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, this is our dashboard proyect. Our goal is to provide helpful information about the state of Barcelona's public bike service, [Bicing](https://www.bicing.barcelona/).

## Our proyect
We are using [plotly](https://plotly.com/) for our visualizations and the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) framework for serving our app, thus we follow their convenctions for static and templates folders. `visualizations` contains the scripts for all the real-time visualizations. All the graphs based on our graph of the network are precomputed and stored as `html`s inside the `templates` folder.

For our UI we are using the [Soft UI Dasboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/soft-ui-dashboard) based on Bootstrap 4 from Creative Tim.

## Data
In order to get all the needed files you must execute the following command.
```bash
bash fetch_data.sh
```

## How to 
In order to execute correctly this app you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed in your system. Afterwards you should execute the following command on your terminal.
```bash
cd source/docker && docker-compose up
```
This docker-compose will create the app image and get from docker-hub the latest postgres image for the database, insert all required data and start up the app. It is accessible through the port `8000` in your `localhost`.
